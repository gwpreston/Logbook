# Changelog

All notable changes to Logbook are recorded here. Database changes are always
shipped as reversible migrations; any upgrade step beyond "pull and restart"
is called out explicitly.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-27

First release: Phases 0 and 1 (foundations, accounts and garage).

### Added — Phase 1: accounts and garage
- First-run setup: a fresh instance asks for the owner account (username,
  password, display name, units, currency, language, time zone) and is
  unreachable once an account exists.
- Sign in / sign out / change password. Argon2id hashes; database-backed
  sessions (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` over HTTPS, scoped to
  `APP_BASE_PATH`, 30-day idle expiry, new id on sign-in); changing the
  password signs out other devices; failed sign-ins are logged for fail2ban.
- CSRF protection (slim/csrf) on every form, with a friendly "form expired"
  page; oversized uploads are reported as "too large".
- Garage: add, edit, delete (with a confirmation page) and archive/restore
  vehicles — cars and motorbikes, fuel type, tank or battery capacity, VIN,
  purchase and sale details, and a per-vehicle currency. Archived vehicles are
  hidden from active views and left out of fleet totals, history kept.
- Vehicle photos (JPEG, PNG, WebP up to `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`), checked by content,
  stored under `UPLOAD_PATH` with random names and served only to the
  signed-in owner.
- Settings: display name, theme (System/Light/Dark, also from the quick
  toggle), distance / fuel volume / fuel economy units (L/100 km, km/L,
  mpg UK and mpg US; Metric/UK/US presets), default currency, language with
  regional formats (e.g. English (United Kingdom)) and time zone. Changes apply
  on the next page.
- Units, money and dates engine for later phases: SI storage with conversion
  at the edges, exact decimal money (zero is valid, ≥3 decimals), calendar
  dates vs UTC instants, DST-safe local-time parsing.
- New configuration: `APP_CURRENCY` (default `GBP`). `SESSION_SECRET` is now
  used (optional).

### Development
- `bin/dev`: start/stop the Docker dev stack, switch between PostgreSQL,
  MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite (each keeps its own data), reset the database and
  load sample data (`DemoDataSeeder`: a demo owner and five vehicles).
- Shell scripts in `bin/` are now committed as executable.

### Database
- New tables `users`, `sessions` and `vehicles` (reversible migrations,
  tested on PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite). No manual upgrade steps.

### Added — Phase 0: foundations
- Slim 4 application skeleton with PHP-DI, Doctrine DBAL, Twig, Monolog and
  symfony/translation (ICU); English catalogue as default and fallback.
- PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite support. Every database session is
  pinned to UTC.
- Phinx migrations; baseline `settings` table.
- `GET /health` (200/503 JSON) for monitoring and the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`.
- Subpath hosting via `APP_BASE_PATH`, working whether the reverse proxy
  forwards or strips the prefix; deep links survive a hard refresh.
- Friendly, translated error pages; exception details only with `APP_DEBUG`,
  always HTML-escaped.
- Docker image (PHP 8.4 + Apache; amd64 and arm64, 64-bit only) with a single `/data`
  volume, auto-migration on start, and compose files for PostgreSQL, MySQL and
  development.
- Bare-PHP support: `.htaccess`, Apache/nginx/Caddy examples, cron runner
  placeholder, `composer start` dev server.
- Quality gates: phpcs (PSR-12), PHPStan (level max), PHPUnit. CI runs them on
  PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB (PHP 8.4 and 8.5) and smoke-tests the image.

### Added — design system and app shell
- Design tokens (colour, typography, spacing, radii) for light and dark themes,
  following the OS by default with a JS toggle that is remembered per browser.
- Responsive shell: sidebar on wide screens, top bar and bottom tab bar on
  phones; Logbook logo and wordmark.
- Self-hosted Outfit and Plus Jakarta Sans fonts and a Material Symbols icon
  sprite (no CDN requests); base components for cards, lists, buttons, chips,
  forms, pills and alerts.
